BP = CA + KA

$P_i = E P_i^*$

Thus

$E = \frac{P}{P^*}$

If domestic price level doubles due to inflation ($P \to 2P$) but foreign price level remains constant ($P^*$ remains same), then the domestic currency must depreciate ($E \to 2E$)


Rate of change of exchange rate equals the differential in interest rates

---

$$R = \frac{EP^*}{P}$$

---

A high interest rate currency should be associated with an expectation of depreciation
