Taylor rule

$$
i = r^* + \pi + 0.5 (\pi - \pi^*) + 0.5\frac{Y - Y^*}{Y^*}
$$

$i$ = nominal interest rate
$\pi$  = current inflation
$\pi^*$ = target inflation
$r^*$ = equilibrium interest rate (e.g. 2%)
$Y$ = actual output
$Y^*$ = potential output

Phillips Curve: Which statement best describes the Phillips curve in the medium run? 
A. It is downward-sloping: higher inflation always means lower unemployment. 
B. It is upward-sloping: higher inflation always means higher unemployment. 
C. It is vertical: unemployment stays at the natural rate regardless of inflation. 
D. It is horizontal: any level of unemployment can coexist with stable inflation.
